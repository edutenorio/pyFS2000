# pyFS2000

Welcome to pyFS2000! This Python library provides tools and utilities to work with files generated by the FS2000 software, a powerful suite of programs for subsea engineering structural analysis developed by AEK-UK. The FS2000 software is widely used in the industry for its comprehensive analysis capabilities, and this library aims to provide additional ways of working with the software data files within your Python projects.

This non-profit, open-source project is developed and maintained by Eduardo Tenorio Bastos and is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license.

## Installation

To install pyFS2000, you can use pip:

```sh
pip install pyFS2000
```

## Quick Start

Here is a quick example to get you started with pyFS2000:

```python
import pyFS2000

# Load an FS2000 file
file_path = 'path/to/your/MODEL_NAME.XYZ'
model = pyFS2000.Model()
model.load(file_path)

# Access data
print(model.header)

# Generate a material take-off grouped by material and sections
groups = dict()
for mat in model.MaterialList.filter(DENS__gt=0):
    for geom in model.GeometryList:
        group = model.ElementList.filter(MAT=mat, GEOM=geom)
        if group.count() == 0:
            continue
        key = f'{mat.MATNAM}, {geom.NAME} '
        key += f'{geom.od*1000:.1f} x {geom.wt*1000:.2f}' if geom.NAME == 'PIP' else f'{geom.DESIGNATION}'
        length = group.sum('length') + (groups[key][0] if key in groups else 0)
        weight = length * mat.DENS * geom.ax + (groups[key][1] if key in groups else 0)
        groups[key] = (length, weight)
print('Material, Section, Length (m), Weight (kg)')
for key, value in groups.items():
    print(f'{key}, {value[0]}, {value[1]}')
```

## Features

- **Loading and Saving**: Easily load and save FS2000 files.
- **Data Processing**: Perform various data processing operations.
- **Analysis Tools**: Access and manipulate generated output files.

## Usage

### Loading FS2000 Files

```python
import pyFS2000

# Load an FS2000 file
file_path = 'path/to/your/MODEL_NAME.XYZ'
model = pyFS2000.Model()
model.load(file_path)
```

### Accessing Data

```python
# Get the material with material number 1
mat = model.MaterialList.get(1)
# Get a list of elements whose length is greater than 10
long_elements = model.ElementList.filter(length_gt=10)
```

### Processing Data

```python
element = model.ElementList.get(1)
element.MAT = 2
```

### Saving Files

```python
model.save()
model.save_as('NEW_MODEL_NAME')
```
